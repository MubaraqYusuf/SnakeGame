#Snake Game
A modern take on the classic Snake arcade game. Guide the snake with your arrow keys to collect food, grow longer, and rack up your scoreâ€”all while avoiding collisions with the walls or your own tail.

#Overview
Objective: Eat food to grow the snake and increase your score.

Gameplay: The snake moves continuously. Use arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to change its direction. With each piece of food consumed, the snake grows longer, making navigation increasingly challenging.

Game Over: The game ends when the snake collides with the board's boundary or with itself.

#Key Features
Simple Controls: Easy-to-learn arrow key navigation.

Endless Challenge: Aim for your highest score as the snake grows longer.

Classic Fun: Enjoy the timeless gameplay of one of the most beloved arcade classics.

#How to Play
Start the Game: Open index.html in your browser.

Control the Snake: Use the arrow keys to direct the snake towards the food.

Avoid Collisions: Steer clear of the walls and the snake's own tail to keep playing.

Score Points: Every time the snake eats food, your score increases and the snake grows.
